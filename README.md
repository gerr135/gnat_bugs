# gnat_bugs
A collection of the encountered bugs in gnat compiler

# About
This is a holding place for the gnat bugs I encountered, to be reported to AdaCore. Somehow I seem to trigger gnat failures on a somewhat regular basis during design phases. This project holds a collection of the individual examples of the cleaned-up and, as much as possible, minimal code that triggers the associated bugs in gnat compiler. Each subproject will also strive to list the progress of the associated bug report and resolution, as well as present known workarounds for a specific issue.
