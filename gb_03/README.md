# Gnat bug #3: gnat cannot handle tagged type hierarchy as discriminated record entry
This happens while trying to have a tagged type hierarchy, rooted in an interface, as a filed of a discriminated record.
Stabdalone variables work fin, just as a field of an undiscriminated record.

## Priority
High, legitimate code representing what should be a common scenario breaks gnat.

## Status
Fixed upstream, to be incorporated in next version of gnat.
Received an email from AdaCore acknowledging the bug and, a week or tow later, announcing the fix in their internal tree.

## Workarounds
Avoid discriminants passed to the type hierarchy? That pretty much means avoiding fixed/bounded list implementations for now..

## Bug message
